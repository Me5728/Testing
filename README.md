# CardioTree Classifier Project (GWC Pathways)

This app presents a rudimentary Heart Disease Predictor which serves to analyze the likelihood of having/developing heart disease based on genetic and lifestyle factors through the Decision Tree machine learning model.


### Project Requirements
This project should:
- Show the dataframe after being label encoded and one hot encoded.
- Use at least two parameters when creating your Decision Tree.
- Print the training accuracy score, testing accuracy score, and confusion matrix.
- Print how a Decision Tree can be applied to a different field, and give 2-3 factors to be wary of.
- Print a text representation of your Decision Tree through the console.

### Takeaways
Over the course of this project, I learned how to import and train a Descision Tree model in a series of data. I also learned about bias in data and how to make sure the model is looking for actual patterns instead of random characteristics. I developed skills in mahcine learning, confusion matrices, and analyzinig data + results. The main component of this proect that I struggled with was learning how to utilize the sklearn libarary and its many tools.

## File Overview

### ← README.md

README.md file give you more documentation and information about a program. They are super helpful for describing what a program should do, any issues you've encountered, changes you want to make, and more. 

### ← main.py
This is where you will write your main program.

### ← heartDisease_2020_sampling.csv
This csv file contains data on factors of heart disease. You can learn more about this dataset in your worksheet in Part 2: https://assets.ctfassets.net/idmfh0ehr6d7/3gBpyycY5ShWzLSG3GuH2K/cb483e835f1d29eeaa74d29d1453a9b8/Intro_to_Machine_Learning_Worksheets.pdf
